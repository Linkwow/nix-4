Math Ops was created for simple mathematics operations with two data types Integer and Double.
It is possible to add a new data type. For this should create a new Interface, which will add all classes of new data type.
Create a new factory, which will return actual class with operations.
Add a new method to FactoryControlService which will return your class entity.
Also logic is able to modified, e.g you can add a new interface to union all factory class. And then create a factory for FactoryControlService.
